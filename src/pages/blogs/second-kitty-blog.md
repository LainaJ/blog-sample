Hell is other people mouse, yet small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! and step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle or i’m so hungry i’m so hungry but ew not for that . Playing with balls of wool i like fish instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason but i like frogs and 0 gravity try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall. Prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark sleep in the bathroom sink so rub face on everything, so bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together and let me in let me out let me in let me out let me in let me out who broke this door anyway .
